# dbscan
to detect features of mosquitos by clustering and traditional methods
# code
All the functions involved in algorithms used in this approach are in MosquitoClass.py, and the setup code is Mosquito_Vision.py.
The rest .py files except MosquitoClass.py and Mosquito_Vision.py are useless, because they were produced during debug and test process.
# Images
All needed images are stored in SaveImage folder. you can choose to store them or not. 
# Result
14 correctly detected/20 mosquitoes = 70% accuracy in this image.
The accuracy overall is about 70%~80% untill hundreds mosquitoes were tested by this approach.
